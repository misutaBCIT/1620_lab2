    <h1>About Me: Zachary Le</h1>
    
    <p> Hello, my name is Minh but I'm usually called Zachary. I've worked many
    jobs over the years but nothing ever related to computing. I enrolled into
    the CIT program because I've always had a casual interest in computers and
    believe that there will be a need for more IT professionals in the new era
    of virtual workplaces.</p>
    
    <p>I was born in Edmonton but lived in East Vancouver since I was 6. 
    My hobbies include road cycling, cooking, and simulation
    car racing. </p>
